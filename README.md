# Addition Game - Castle Connon Siege

This branch showcases a 2D cannonball trajectory simulation using Unity's physics engine. The goal is to simulate realistic projectile motion, allowing users to adjust the angle and power of the shot and visualize the predicted trajectory with white dots before firing. The game accurately follows real-world physics principles, including gravity, velocity, and collision detection.
